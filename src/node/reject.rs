//! Typed rejection reasons for silent-rejection sites across the node.
//!
//! Every rejection-and-return path in the node should classify its
//! reason via [`RejectReason`] and pass the result to
//! [`NodeStats::record_reject`](crate::node::stats::NodeStats::record_reject)
//! so operators can see *what* is being rejected via stats counters
//! rather than via log scraping.
//!
//! The top-level variant set mirrors the protocol-layer / subsystem
//! split that the [`NodeStats`](crate::node::stats::NodeStats)
//! sub-structures already follow, with additional categories
//! (`Handshake`/`Session`/`Mmp`/`Forwarding`/`Transport`) for known
//! silent-rejection clusters that don't yet have dedicated stats
//! sub-structures.
//!
//! The second-level enums are marked `#[non_exhaustive]` to keep the
//! door open for additions without semver concerns from any future
//! external crates.
