A distributed, decentralized network routing protocol for mesh nodes
connecting over arbitrary transports.

> FIPS is under active development. The protocol and APIs are not yet stable.
> See [Status & Roadmap](#status--roadmap) below.

## Overview

FIPS is a self-organizing mesh network that operates natively over a variety
of physical and logical media — local area networks, Bluetooth, serial links,
radio, or the existing internet as an overlay. Nodes generate their own
identities, discover each other, and route traffic without any central
authority or global topology knowledge.

FIPS uses Nostr keypairs (secp256k1/schnorr) as native node identities,
allowing users to generate their own persistent or ephemeral node addresses.
Nodes address each other by npub, and the same cryptographic identity serves
as both the routing address and the basis for end-to-end encrypted sessions
across the mesh.

FIPS allows existing TCP/IP based network software to use the FIPS mesh
network by generating a local IP address from the node npub and tunnelling
IP packets to other endpoints transparently knowing only their npub. Native
FIPS-aware applications do not need this IP tunneling or emulation capability.

All traffic over the FIPS mesh is encrypted and authenticated both
hop-to-hop between peers and independently end-to-end between FIPS
endpoints.

## Features

- **Self-organizing mesh routing** — spanning tree coordinates with bloom
  filter guided discovery, no global routing tables
- **Multi-transport** — UDP, TCP, Ethernet, Tor, and Bluetooth (BLE L2CAP)
  today; designed for serial and radio
- **Noise encryption** — hop-by-hop link encryption and independent
  end-to-end session encryption (both Noise XX), with periodic rekey for
  forward secrecy and protocol negotiation in the handshake
- **Nostr-native identity** — secp256k1 keypairs as node addresses, no
  registration or central authority
- **IPv6 adaptation** — TUN interface maps npubs to fd00::/8 addresses
  for unmodified IP applications; built-in `.fips` DNS resolver with
  optional static hostname mapping (`/etc/fips/hosts`)
- **Outbound LAN gateway** — optional `fips-gateway` daemon lets
  unmodified LAN hosts reach `.fips` destinations via a
  DNS-allocated virtual IP pool and kernel nftables NAT
- **Metrics Measurement Protocol** — per-link RTT, loss, jitter, and goodput
  measurement with mesh size estimation
- **ECN congestion signaling** — hop-by-hop CE flag relay with RFC 3168 IPv6
  marking, transport kernel drop detection
- **Operator visibility** — `fipsctl` CLI and `fipstop` TUI dashboard for
  runtime inspection and runtime peer management
- **Zero configuration** — sensible defaults; a node can start with no config
  file, though peer addresses are needed to join a network

## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmcorgan/fips.git
cd fips
cargo build --release
```

Requires Rust 1.85+ (edition 2024). Linux, macOS, and Windows are
supported (see transport matrix below).

### Transport support by platform

| Transport | Linux | macOS | Windows | OpenWrt |
|-----------|:-----:|:-----:|:-------:|:-------:|
| UDP       |  ✅   |  ✅   |   ✅    |   ✅    |
| TCP       |  ✅   |  ✅   |   ✅    |   ✅    |
| Ethernet  |  ✅   |  ✅   |   ❌    |   ✅    |
| Tor       |  ✅   |  ✅   |   ✅    |   ✅    |
| BLE       |  ✅   |  ❌   |   ❌    |   ❌    |

On **Linux**, the BLE transport requires BlueZ and libdbus. On
Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install bluez libdbus-1-dev`. Then build with
BLE enabled: `cargo build --release --features ble`.

On **OpenWrt**, BLE is disabled because libdbus is not available on
the target. All other transports work and ship in the default ipk.

## Installation

After building, choose one of the following methods to install.

### Debian / Ubuntu (.deb)

Requires [cargo-deb](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-deb):

```bash
cargo install cargo-deb
cargo deb
sudo dpkg -i target/debian/fips_*.deb
```

This installs the daemon, CLI tools, systemd units, and a default
configuration. Edit `/etc/fips/fips.yaml` before starting:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fips/fips.yaml
sudo systemctl start fips
```

The service is enabled at boot automatically. To use `fipsctl` and
`fipstop` without sudo, add your user to the `fips` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG fips $USER    # log out and back in to take effect
```

Remove with `sudo dpkg -r fips` (preserves config) or
`sudo dpkg -P fips` (removes everything including identity keys).

### Generic Linux (systemd tarball)

```bash
./packaging/systemd/build-tarball.sh
tar xzf deploy/fips-*-linux-*.tar.gz
cd fips-*-linux-*/
sudo ./install.sh
```

See [packaging/systemd/README.install.md](packaging/systemd/README.install.md)
for the full installation and configuration guide.

### macOS (.pkg)

```bash
./packaging/macos/build-pkg.sh
sudo installer -pkg deploy/fips-*-macos-*.pkg -target /
```

This installs binaries to `/usr/local/bin/`, config to
`/usr/local/etc/fips/`, sets up `.fips` DNS resolution via
`/etc/resolver/fips`, and registers a launchd daemon. Edit
`/usr/local/etc/fips/fips.yaml` before starting:

```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/etc/fips/fips.yaml
sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.fips.daemon.plist
```

Remove with `sudo packaging/macos/uninstall.sh` (preserves config).

To restart the node after making configuration changes:

```bash
sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.fips.daemon.plist
sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.fips.daemon.plist
```

Check logs for troubleshooting:

```bash
sudo tail -f /usr/local/var/log/fips/fips.log
```

> **Note:** On macOS, the TUN device is named `utun<N>` (kernel-assigned)
> rather than `fips0`.

### Windows

Build without BLE (requires Linux-only libdbus):

```powershell
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features tui
```

The [wintun](https://www.wintun.net/) driver is required for TUN support.
Download `wintun.dll` and place it in the same directory as `fips.exe`.
Running the daemon requires Administrator privileges for TUN creation.

**Foreground mode:**

```powershell
.\fips.exe -c fips.yaml
```

**Windows Service:**

```powershell
# Install (requires Administrator)
.\fips.exe --install-service

# Manage via standard service tools
sc start fips
sc stop fips

# Uninstall
.\fips.exe --uninstall-service
```

Place `fips.yaml` in the current directory or `%APPDATA%\fips\`, or set
the `FIPS_CONFIG` environment variable.

The control socket uses TCP on `localhost:21210` instead of a Unix domain
socket. `fipsctl` and `fipstop` connect to this port automatically.

## Configuration

The default configuration file is installed at `/etc/fips/fips.yaml`:

```yaml
# FIPS Node Configuration

node:
  identity:
    # By default, a new ephemeral keypair is generated on each start.
    # Uncomment persistent to keep the same identity across restarts;
    # on first start a keypair is saved to fips.key/fips.pub next to
    # this config file (mode 0600/0644).
    # persistent: true
    #
    # Or set an explicit key (overrides persistent):
    # nsec: "nsec1..."

tun:
  enabled: true
  name: fips0
  mtu: 1280

dns:
  enabled: true
  bind_addr: "127.0.0.1"
  port: 5354

transports:
  udp:
    bind_addr: "0.0.0.0:2121"

  tcp:
    # Accepts inbound connections. No static outbound peers.
    bind_addr: "0.0.0.0:8443"

  # Ethernet transport — uncomment and set your interface name.
  # ethernet:
  #   interface: "eth0"
  #   discovery: true
  #   announce: true
  #   auto_connect: true
  #   accept_connections: true

peers:
  # Static peers for bootstrapping (UDP or TCP):
  - npub: "npub1qmc3cvfz0yu2hx96nq3gp55zdan2qclealn7xshgr448d3nh6lks7zel98"
    alias: "fips-test-node"
    addresses:
      - transport: udp
        addr: "217.77.8.91:2121"
    connect_policy: auto_connect
```

for the full reference.

## Usage

### DNS Resolution

FIPS includes a DNS resolver (enabled by default, port 5354) that maps
`.fips` names to fd00::/8 IPv6 addresses.

**Linux**: The `.deb` package auto-detects and configures whichever
resolver is present (systemd dns-delegate, systemd-resolved, dnsmasq,
or NetworkManager with dnsmasq); no manual setup is needed. For
manual or tarball installs, point your resolver at `127.0.0.1:5354`
for the `fips` domain — e.g., with systemd-resolved:

```bash
sudo resolvectl dns fips0 127.0.0.1:5354
sudo resolvectl domain fips0 ~fips
```

**macOS**: DNS is configured automatically by the `.pkg` installer via
`/etc/resolver/fips`. No manual setup is needed.

Then reach any FIPS node by npub with standard IPv6 tools:

```bash
ping6 npub1bbb....fips
ssh -6 npub1bbb....fips
```

> **macOS note:** Use `ping6` instead of `ping`. macOS ships separate
> `ping` (IPv4-only) and `ping6` (IPv6) binaries; `ping` will not
> resolve AAAA records. Similarly, use `curl -6`, `ssh -6`, etc. when
> connecting by `.fips` hostname.

### Monitoring

Use `fipsctl` to query a running node:

```bash
fipsctl show status         # Node status overview
fipsctl show peers          # Authenticated peers and security state
fipsctl show links          # Active links
fipsctl show tree           # Spanning tree state
fipsctl show sessions       # End-to-end sessions and rekey health
fipsctl show bloom          # Bloom filter state
fipsctl show mmp            # MMP metrics summary
fipsctl show cache          # Coordinate cache entries and routes
fipsctl show connections    # Pending handshake connections
fipsctl show transports     # Transport instances
fipsctl show routing        # Routing, discovery, and retry state
fipsctl show identity-cache # Known node identities (npubs)
```

`fipstop` provides an interactive TUI dashboard with live-updating
views of node status, peers, links, sessions, tree state, transports,
and routing:

```bash
fipstop                   # connect to local daemon
fipstop -r 1              # 1-second refresh interval
```

### Service Management

```bash
sudo systemctl start fips
sudo systemctl stop fips
sudo systemctl restart fips
sudo journalctl -u fips -f
```

### Testing

See [testing/](testing/) for Docker-based integration test harnesses
including static topology tests and stochastic chaos simulation.

## Examples

- [examples/sidecar-nostr-relay/](examples/sidecar-nostr-relay/) —
  Run a [strfry](https://github.com/hoytech/strfry) Nostr relay
  reachable exclusively over the FIPS mesh. The relay container shares
  the FIPS sidecar's network namespace and is isolated from the host
  network.
- [examples/k8s-sidecar/](examples/k8s-sidecar/) — Run FIPS as a
  Kubernetes Pod sidecar. The sidecar creates `fips0` in the Pod's
  shared network namespace so every other container in the Pod gets
  mesh access without modification.
- [examples/wireguard-sidecar-macos/](examples/wireguard-sidecar-macos/) —
  Reach the FIPS mesh from a macOS host through a local Docker
  container over a WireGuard tunnel. Only traffic destined for
  `fd00::/8` transits the sidecar; regular internet traffic continues
  to use the host network.

## Status & Roadmap

FIPS is at **v0.2.0**. The core protocol works end-to-end over UDP, TCP,
Ethernet, Tor, and Bluetooth (BLE) with a small live mesh of deployed nodes.

### What works today

- Spanning tree construction with greedy coordinate routing
- Bloom filter guided discovery (no flooding, single-path with retry)
- Noise XX encryption at both layers with protocol negotiation
- Periodic Noise rekey with hitless cutover for forward secrecy (FMP + FSP)
- Persistent node identity with key file management
- IPv6 TUN adapter with built-in `.fips` DNS resolver and multi-backend
  auto-configuration (systemd dns-delegate, systemd-resolved, dnsmasq,
  NetworkManager)
- Static hostname mapping (`/etc/fips/hosts`) with auto-reload
- Per-link metrics (RTT, loss, jitter, goodput) and mesh size estimation
- ECN congestion signaling (hop-by-hop CE relay, IPv6 CE marking, kernel drop detection)
- UDP, TCP, Ethernet, Tor, and BLE transports (BLE via L2CAP CoC with per-link MTU negotiation)
- Outbound LAN gateway for unmodified hosts via DNS-allocated virtual IPs and nftables NAT
- Runtime inspection and peer management via `fipsctl` and `fipstop`
- Reproducible builds with toolchain pinning and SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
- Linux (Debian, systemd tarball, OpenWrt, AUR), macOS (`.pkg`), and Windows (ZIP, service) packaging
- Docker-based integration and chaos testing
- Nostr-mediated overlay endpoint discovery and UDP hole punching for
  NAT traversal — peers publish endpoint adverts on public Nostr
  relays, exchange candidates via NIP-59 gift-wrapped offers/answers,
  and establish direct paths through NATs using STUN-assisted
  punching (behind the `nostr-discovery` cargo feature)

### Near-term priorities

- Native API for FIPS-aware applications (npub:port addressing)
- Security audit of cryptographic protocols

### Longer-term

- Mobile platform support
- Bandwidth-aware routing and QoS
- Protocol stability and versioned wire format
- Published crate
