## Breaking

_Wire-format and API breaking changes for the next major release._

## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Bluetooth Transport

- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) L2CAP Connection-Oriented Channel transport
  with per-link MTU negotiation, behind the `ble` Cargo feature flag
  (default-on, Linux only, requires BlueZ)
- BLE peer discovery via continuous scan/probe with cooldown-based
  deduplication (`probe_cooldown_secs`, default 30s)
- Continuous BLE advertising for reliable L2CAP connectivity
- Cross-probe tie-breaker using deterministic NodeAddr comparison
- Connection pool with configurable capacity and eviction

#### Packaging and Deployment

- Linux release artifact workflow: builds x86_64 and aarch64 tarballs
  and `.deb` packages on `v*` tag push, with SHA-256 checksums
- AUR publish workflow for tagged stable releases
- Arch Linux AUR packaging for `fips` (release) and `fips-git`
  (development) packages with sysusers.d/tmpfiles.d integration
  ([#21](https://github.com/jmcorgan/fips/pull/21),
  [@dskvr](https://github.com/dskvr))

### Fixed

- Control socket path detection in fipsctl and fipstop now checks for
  the `/run/fips/` directory instead of the socket file inside it, so
  users not yet in the `fips` group get a clear "Permission denied"
  error instead of a misleading "No such file" fallback to
  `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` ([#30](https://github.com/jmcorgan/fips/issues/30),
  reported by [@Sebastix](https://github.com/Sebastix))
- OpenWrt ipk build excluded BLE feature that requires D-Bus, which is
  unavailable on OpenWrt targets
- IPv6 routing policy rule added at TUN setup to protect `fd00::/8`
  from interception by Tailscale's table 52 default route

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

#### Operator Tooling

- `fipsctl connect` and `disconnect` commands for runtime peer
  management via control socket, with hostname resolution from
  `/etc/fips/hosts`

#### IPv6 Adapter

- Pre-seed identity cache from configured peer npubs at startup, so TUN packets can be dispatched immediately without waiting for handshake completion ([@v0l](https://github.com/v0l))

#### Mesh Peer Transports

- New Tor transport with SOCKS5 and directory-mode onion service for anonymous inbound and outbound peering
- DNS hostname support in peer addresses for UDP and TCP transports
- Non-blocking transport connect for connection-oriented transports (TCP, Tor)

#### Packaging and Deployment

- Reproducible build infrastructure: Rust toolchain pinning via
  `rust-toolchain.toml`, `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` in CI and packaging
  scripts, deterministic archive timestamps
- Top-level packaging Makefile for unified build across formats
- Kubernetes sidecar deployment example with Nostr relay demo
- Nostr release publishing in OpenWrt package workflow
- SHA-256 hash output in CI build and OpenWrt workflows

#### Testing and CI

- Maelstrom chaos scenario with dynamic topology mutation and
  ephemeral node identities via connect/disconnect commands
- Consolidated Docker test harness infrastructure

### Changed

- Discovery protocol: replace flooding with bloom-filter-guided tree
  routing. Includes originator retry (T=0/T=5s/T=10s), exponential
  backoff after timeouts and bloom misses, and transit-side per-target
  rate limiting. Removed 257-byte visited bloom filter from LookupRequest wire format. *This is a breaking change; nodes running versions prior to this release will not be compatible.*

### Fixed

- DNS responder returned NXDOMAIN for A queries on valid `.fips` names,
  causing resolvers to give up without trying AAAA. Now returns NOERROR
  with empty answers for non-AAAA queries on resolvable names.
  (#9, reported by [@alopatindev](https://github.com/alopatindev))
- Stale end-to-end session left in session table after peer removal blocked session re-establishment on reconnect — `remove_active_peer` now cleans up `self.sessions` and `self.pending_tun_packets`. (#5, [@v0l](https://github.com/v0l))
- `schedule_reconnect` reset exponential backoff to zero on each link-dead
  cycle instead of preserving accumulated retry count.
  (#5, [@v0l](https://github.com/v0l))
- FMP/FSP rekey dual-initiation race on high-latency links (Tor): both
  sides' timers fired simultaneously, both msg1s crossed in flight, each
  side's responder path destroyed the initiator state. Fixed with
  deterministic tie-breaker (smaller NodeAddr wins as initiator).
- Parent selection SRTT gate bypass: `evaluate_parent` used default cost
  1.0 for peers filtered out by `has_srtt()`, defeating the MMP eligibility
  gate. Now skips unmeasured candidates when any peer has cost data.
- FSP rekey cutover race: initiator cut over before responder received msg3,
  causing AEAD failures. Fixed by deferring initiator cutover by 2 seconds.
- MMP metric discontinuity after rekey: receiver state carried stale
  counters across rekey, inflating reorder counts and jitter. Fixed via
  `reset_for_rekey()`.
- Auto-connect peers exhausted `max_retries` on initial connection failures
  and were permanently abandoned. Now retry indefinitely with exponential
  backoff capped at 300 seconds.
- Control socket permissions: non-root users couldn't connect. Daemon now
  chowns socket and directory to `root:fips` group at bind time.
- Post-rekey jitter spikes: old-session frames arriving via the drain window
  produced 2,000–7,000ms jitter spikes that corrupted the EWMA estimator.
  Added a 15-second grace period after rekey cutover that suppresses jitter
  updates until drain-window frames have flushed. (#10)
- ICMPv6 Packet Too Big source was set to the local FIPS address, which
  Linux ignores (loopback PTB check). Now uses the original packet's
  destination so the kernel honors the PMTU update.
  (#16, [@v0l](https://github.com/v0l))
- Reverse delivery ratio used lifetime cumulative counters instead of
  per-interval deltas, making ETX unresponsive to recent loss. (#14)
- MMP delta guards used `prev_rr > 0` to detect first report, conflating
  it with a legitimate zero counter. Replaced with `has_prev_rr`. (#14)
