//! Read-side state snapshots published from the node's natural mutators so
//! pure-snapshot `show_*` queries render off the rx_loop hot path.
//!
//! [`StatsSnapshot`] is the R2 reference implementation of the canonical
//! snapshot pattern (see `design/fast-path-refactoring-r0-read-handle.md`): a
//! read-only data bundle published via `ArcSwap` from the tick after
//! `StatsHistory::tick()`. It carries
//!
//! - the `stats_history` read-side rings (the "dual-ring": the live mutable
//!   ring stays on the tick; this is the cloned read copy), and
//! - the cheap scalar gauges `show_status` needs (`estimated_mesh_size`,
//!   node `state`, `tun_state`, `tun_name`, `effective_ipv6_mtu`, and the
//!   peer / session / link / connection / transport counts), plus
//!   `peer_aliases` (effectively immutable after construction).
//!
//! The snapshot holds *data*, not rendered `Response` envelopes (Q1-d):
//! rendering happens in the control task off the rx_loop. Staleness is bounded
//! by the tick interval and is never staler than the underlying data, which
//! also advances only on the tick (Q1-b).

/// R4 as `entities — ArcSwap<EntitySnapshot>: peers / sessions / links /

/// structural sharing`. This is that cell.
///
/// **Structural sharing (the umbrella mandate).** Every entity table is a
/// `Vec<Arc<Row>>`, so a republish in which only one row changed re-allocates
/// only that one `Arc<Row>` — the unchanged rows are reused by pointer from the
/// previous snapshot (`Arc::ptr_eq`-stable). The publisher diffs each freshly
/// projected row against the prior published row by value (`PartialEq`) and
/// keeps the old `Arc` when they are equal. A clone of the snapshot for each
/// accepted control connection is then a vector of cheap pointer clones, not a
/// deep table copy. This is what keeps the per-tick publish cost off the hot
/// path at scale, as the umbrella requires for R4.
///
/// **Publisher placement (Q1).** Like R3, this is published from the **tick**,
/// not per-mutator. Two reasons, both stronger than for R3:
///
/// 1. Every projected row needs a *display name* resolved against the live
///    peer/session tables and host map (`&Node`), and `show_peers` additionally
///    needs the live tree state to derive `is_parent` / `is_child` and the
///    Nostr-discovery failure-state map — cross-subsystem reads available only
///    with `&Node`.
/// 2. Most of the projected fields (link/session traffic counters, MMP
///    metrics, `last_seen`, noise counters, replay/decrypt counters) are
///    mutated continuously on the **data plane / rx_loop**, not at the discrete
///    peer/session/link lifecycle mutators. Per-lifecycle-mutator publication
///    (Q1-a) would therefore not even capture freshness for those fields; the
///    tick is the natural cadence at which this read view advances.
///
/// The diff-and-reuse therefore satisfies the structural-sharing goal the
/// umbrella mandates (only changed rows re-allocate) while keeping a single
/// coherent `&Node` publisher — the "no monolithic per-tick *re-allocation* of
/// every row" warning is honored because unchanged rows are reused, not rebuilt.
/// This is the documented acceptable interim (the spec's tick-publish-with-
